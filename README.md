# Interactive-room
IoT project, using Node.js + Express + Johnny-Five (Arduino) + React.

The main idea of the project is to interact with devices that we usually find in a room.

# Scripts: 

  npm run interactive-room  ==> runs the whole project, Node (server + arduino) and React.
  
  npm run server ==> starts nodeserver with nodemon.
  
  npm run client ==> starts react development enviroment.
